            Sri Lanka is an island nation located in the Indian Ocean, just off the southeastern coast of India. Despite
            its modest size—slightly larger than the state of West Virginia—Sri Lanka has a population of about 20
            million people, almost equal to the population of Texas. The island is rich in natural resources, and has a
            diverse economy based on agriculture, mining, fishing, manufacturing, and tourism. On becoming an
            independent nation in 1948 Sri Lanka (formerly called Ceylon) seemed to be headed for a future as a stable
            and prosperous democracy. Since the 1970s, however, the country has been torn by violent struggles between
            the two main ethnic groups, Sinhalese and Tamils, that make up its population. Sri Lanka suffered severe
            damage and loss of life from the tsunami of 2004; what effect that disaster will have on the country’s
            political future remains to be seen.

            <h2>Geography</h2>
            <br>
            Shaped like a teardrop, the island of Sri Lanka measures about 255 miles (415 km.) from north to south, and
            about 135 miles (220 km.) from east to west, with a total land area of about 25,300 square miles (65,600
            square km.). It has more than 830 miles (1340 km.) of coastline. The island is ringed by a broad coastal
            plain, rising to an inland terrain of gently rolling hills. A range of mountains dominates the south-central
            interior, with the highest peak, Mt. Piduruthalagala, reaching more than 8200 feet (2524 meters) in height.

            Located between 5 and 10 degrees latitude north of the equator, Sri Lanka has a tropical climate dominated
            by two monsoon seasons. The summer monsoon lasts from mid-May to October, when winds from the southwest
            bring rain from the Indian Ocean to the southern and western parts of the island. During the winter monsoon,
            from December through March, winds from the northeast bring rain from the Bay of Bengal to northern and
            eastern regions. Monsoon rains are constant and heavy, with up to 100 inches of rain per month falling
            during the summer monsoon in the southwest. October-November and mid-March to mid-May are intermonsoon
            seasons, with less rainfall. The climate is hot and humid for much of the year, but is cooler in the
            highlands.
            <br><br>
            <h2>History</h2><br>
            The Ancient Period About 2600 years ago, migrants from northern India, the ancestors of today’s Sinhalese
            people, arrived in Sri Lanka. The Sinhalese were among the earliest people outside northern India to adopt
            the Buddhist religion, which they did around 300 B.C.E. The Buddhist kingdoms of Sri Lanka were related by
            language and culture to the classic states of northern India, such as the Maurya (324-187 B.C.E.) and Gupta
            (c. 320-c.550 C.E.) empires, and were in contact with them through diplomacy and trade.
            The Sri Lankan Buddhist kingdoms flourished by building and controlling irrigation networks on the plains in
            the northern part of the island. One ancient capital, Anuradhapura, was home to some of the largest and most
            impressive Buddhist temples of southern Asia. The ruler of another Sri Lankan state, King Kasyapa (r.
            473-491) made his capital at Sigiriya, a natural rock fortress rising a sheer 500 feet above the surrounding
            plain, on top of which the king built an elegant city of palaces and gardens.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Trade and the Colonial Era</h2><br>
                Long-distance ocean trade in the Indian Ocean region has existed since ancient times. The Roman Empire
                imported luxury goods from Sri Lanka, including gemstones and cinnamon. Sri Lankan ships sailed as far
                west as Arabia, and as far east as China. Arab and Persian merchants knew Sri Lanka as the island of
                Serendib (a word that gives us “serendipity,” meaning “something which comes as a pleasant surprise”).
                “Treasure ships” sent by the emperor of Ming Dynasty China visited Sri Lanka during the 15th century.
            <br> <br>
                Sri Lanka began to feel the impact of Europe soon after Portuguese ships found their way to the Indian
                Ocean at the end of the 15th century. Because Sri Lanka was rich in goods that Europeans wanted, and
                also because it is a convenient place to stop on the way from Europe to Indonesia and China, Europeans
                competed to control the island and its trade. The Portuguese conquered Sri Lanka’s coastal cities in the
                16 th century but faced fierce competition from the Dutch for control of the island. By 1707 the Dutch
                had captured the last of the Portuguese forts along the coast and became the main European power in Sri
                Lanka, but they in turn lost out to the British in 1795-96. By 1818 the British had also defeated the
                independent inland Kingdom of Kandy, and the whole island of Sri Lanka became part of the British
                Empire.<br> <br>
                 Under British colonial rule, the economy of Sri Lanka was transformed to become a producer of
                agricultural products for foreign trade. Soon the economy was dominated by plantation crops such as
                coffee, tea, rubber, and coconuts. The British authorities also encouraged the migration of Tamil
                laborers from southern India to Sri Lanka to work on the plantations. Colonial rule created new elite
                groups, including plantation managers, intellectuals who took advantage of the opportunity to gain a
                western-style education, and bureaucrats who worked for the colonial government. But ethnic problems
                continued to complicate Sri Lankan national life.
